					<h2>Let's be honest: Filling the sales funnel is a lot easier than moving prospects through it.</h2>

          <p>While most B2B organizations invest in world-class marketing automation platform engines-and in some cases have dedicated teams to own and manage it-they still suffer from 'customer stall'.</p>
          <p>The question is...why?</p>
          <p>Tech brands don't always have the content to meet the buyers' unique needs at each stage of their journey. And when buyers can no longer find the information they need from your brand, their buying journey doesn't stop.</p>
          <p>But their engagement with YOUR BRAND does.</p>
          <p>So how can your organization keep buyers engaged and accelerate their sales cycle?</p>

          <h4>Here's how:</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>Rethink Your Content: Create the content buyers seek at each stage of the journey so they can move forward in the evaluation process with confidence</li>
              <li>Better Utilize Your People: Your employees and customers have boots-on-the-ground experience and insights.  Use their expertise to craft more actionable content, to share more relevant insights</li>
              <li>Empower Your Buyers: Enable buyers to progress at their pace-according to their needs and interests&mdash;rather than forcing them into a one-size-fits-all maturity pathway</li>
          </ol><br/><br/>

          <h3>Rethink Your Content</h3>
          <p>Your buyers proactively seek information, insights and real-world expertise that will help move their businesses forward. The brand that gives it to them will win more deals faster, and at higher price-points.</p>
          <p>Start by putting yourself in your buyer's shoes. Think about the kind of information and answers they need at each stage of the evaluation process to move forward confidently. Consider the forms and formats of content they would prefer to interact with, too. Do videos work for this stage of their buyer journey? Do they prefer digital tools to , or do collateral pieces like whitepapers, use cases, solution briefs,  and case studies work better?</p>
          <p>Whether at the Awareness Stage (top funnel), Education Stage (mid-funnel), or Consideration Stage (bottom funnel), embrace the fact that your buyer is "HERE," and focus on giving them everything they need to move forward in the sales process. Don't allow artificial Lead Maturity funnels to restrict buyers from accessing the content they need. Instead, give buyers the ability to binge everything they want when they want it. It's critical to speeding their progression to the next stage in the evaluation process.</p>

          <h3>Utilize Your People</h3>
          <p>You have some of the best and brightest people in the industry. Start leveraging their experience and expertise to connect with buyers at each stage of the journey.</p>
          <p>Think of ways to incorporate your SMEs, C-levels, product leaders, R&D/innovation leaders, and sales leaders into the content development and sales process. Your people talk with customers every day. They speak in your customer's language. Your team can provide uniquely valuable, real-world insights that a static collateral asset simply cannot deliver.</p>
          <p>Use your team's insights and knowledge to update existing content, and create new content that aligns to the unique interests, needs, challenges, and opportunities of your buyers at every stage of their journey.  Create hyper-focused access sessions such as webinars, video interviews, and use case discussions on specific buyer needs and interests.</p>
          <p>The unique knowledge and insights of your people is the backbone of your value proposition. Give them the reigns to do what they do best: Share the story of your brand.</p>

          <h3>Empower Your Buyers</h3>
          <p>Your prospective buyer is not static or generic. Neither are the customers you serve every day. Instead of forcing them into a one-size-fits-all maturity pathway, let buyers progress at their pace, according to their needs and interests. It seems counterintuitive, but giving clients this freedom allows the sales cycle to move faster.</p>

          <h4>Fist, give prospective buyers an opportunity to engage with your brand based on:</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Need (i.e. enable a remote workforce)</li>
              <li>Trend (i.e. IoT, cloud, blockchain, etc.)</li>
              <li>Business outcome (i.e. reduce costs, improve operational performance, etc.)</li>
              <li>Vertical market (i.e. manufacturing, healthcare, etc.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>...and then craft and provide content that aligns to those narratives accordingly.</p>
          <p>Second, make it easy for buyers to educate themselves. Empower them to engage with content that is relevant to their specific needs, opportunities, and goals.</p>
          <p>And lastly, allow buyers to engage your brand at any stage, whenever they are ready. The key is to welcome them with open arms, point them quickly to the right content, and then give them access to the experts and expertise they need to make smart business decisions.</p>
