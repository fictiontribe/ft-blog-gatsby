description: Telling brands that good marketing is about storytelling is like saying that painting is about controlling light and color. It’s not wrong, but it doesn’t help you make it. Because the hard part, of course, is learning how. Well, to start you first have to have a familiarity with the tools at your disposal—specifically, what content works best for the type of story you’re trying to tell.

Telling brands that good marketing is about storytelling is like saying that painting is about controlling light and color. It’s not wrong, but it doesn’t help you make it. Because the hard part, of course, is learning how. Well, to start you first have to have a familiarity with the tools at your disposal—specifically, what content works best for the type of story you’re trying to tell. Don’t worry, this isn’t another post about the buyer’s journey. It’s about what comes before that: building a fundamental understanding of what different assets look like, and what they do best. 

To inform that process, we created Matching Story to Content: Your Guide to Finding the Right Medium. By no means is it an exhaustive source of all content. A compendium like that is theoretical at best, since content can literally be anything. But it does cover the basics. And that’s where content strategy should always start. 

Whether establishing a common language internally or creating a source of truth that guides conversations with clients, here are the three most important reasons to use this guide. 

### Getting clients on the same page (of the same book)
So, why is it important to take a step back and revisit how you define the “what and why” of content? Because we’re not all speaking the same language. What we think of as an infographic or an ebook—even a homepage—has become murky. And it’s causing some problems. For example, you’re in a meeting with a client, talking through content strategy. You suggest an infographic. “Let’s do it!” they say. “Great!” you say. Everyone is nodding. You start producing it and find out that they have no data—nothing with which to illustrate a narrative except words. (So many words.) Turns out what they thought of as an infographic is really a novel with some arrows. In short, these terms have started to morph into one-size-fits-all catchphrases. They’re beginning to lose their meaning and purpose. 

### Avoiding compounded confusion
At Fiction Tribe, we noticed this “language barrier” becoming increasingly problematic. And not just with the more functional asset types—but with less tangible deliverables like concepts too. When we took a closer look, we realized that hints of confusion were starting before any content was even produced. From the very first conversations, through to scoping and statements of work, the same vague language was carrying through and allowing for too much open interpretation. And let’s just say, the time to find out that you and your client don’t have the same deliverable in mind is not when you’re presenting it. 

### To keep from building a box before you know what goes in it
These days, it’s not uncommon for clients to come to the table with a laundry list of assets they already think they need. This is good and bad. It’s good because, well… at least they’re thinking about it. It’s bad because they may not be as open as they could be to telling their story in new, different, and more potent ways. While it may be easier to just take their list as marching orders, agencies need to take the time to dig deeper and design with more focused intent. In other words, that ebook ultimately won’t perform well, because it should have been a video.
