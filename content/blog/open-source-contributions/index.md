Like all the other creators out there, the Fiction Tribe Development team uses a lot of OpenSource tools to power up our daily development. But being a creative team, using other’s work without making community contributions goes against our values. For this reason, we kicked off our series of OpenSource projects to share some techniques and approaches we’ve developed over our years of working with clients with the world. Sometimes it's hard to find free time among client work, but our goal (among many) is to make space to share our knowledge and skills with the community. 

## Here are the two recent additions to our OS library:

### 1) Fiction Tribe Landing Page Boilerplate

Simply, your last boilerplate. 
If your work involves developing Landing Pages or simple interactive experiences for the web, you know how hard it is to find a well-rounded boilerplate to quickly KO development; the boilerplate based on the latest version of Webpack; the one that works well out of the box and isn't cluttered with unnecessary packages. 
We've used our experience to put together this complete starter package, featuring some cool, reusable visual sugar that screams "inspired by Fiction Tribe." 

### 2) AssetCart.js

For landing pages that offer multiple content assets as downloadables, we developed this Widget. It collects all linked assets with a class and adds an animation effect. 

As a user scrolls through the page content, our Widget drops linked content into an asset cart for the user to view and download their collection of deeper content, while keeping the focus on the page. 
This imitates e-commerce cart functionality to improve on-page engagement and form-fill conversion metrics with bundle downloads.
